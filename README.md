# SOLID Principle

The **`SOLID principles`** are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that aim to make software more maintainable, flexible, and understandable. They are guidelines for writing clean and scalable code. In C# (as in other object-oriented languages), adhering to these principles can lead to better software design. Here's an overview of each SOLID principle:

1. **`Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)`**:
* A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.
* This principle encourages you to keep classes focused on a single task or responsibility, making the code easier to understand, modify, and maintain.

2. **`Open-Closed Principle (OCP)`**:
* Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* This principle encourages you to design your classes and systems in a way that allows for adding new functionality by extending existing code rather than changing it.
* Techniques such as using abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism can help achieve this.

3. **`Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)`**:
* Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
* In practical terms, this means that derived classes should extend, not override or change, the behavior of their base classes. Clients of a base class should be able to use derived classes without knowing it.

4. **`Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)`**:
* Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
* This principle encourages you to create small, specific interfaces for classes to implement rather than large, monolithic interfaces.
* It helps avoid the "fat interface" problem where classes are forced to implement methods they don't need.

5. **`Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)`**:
* High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
* Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
* This principle promotes loose coupling by advocating the use of abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple high-level and low-level modules, allowing for easier changes and substitutions of components.

By applying the SOLID principles in your C# code, you can create more maintainable, modular, and extensible software. These principles help you design classes and systems that are less prone to bugs and easier to refactor as requirements change.
